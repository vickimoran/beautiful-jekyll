My name is Vicki Moran. Growing up, I always had a fond interest in building circuits (anyone remember [this guy](https://www.elenco.com/product/snap-circuits-300-experiments/)?). By learning technical skills through various courses and applying this knowledge to several projects, I have become competent at designing, implementing and testing electrical systems, both analog and digital.
