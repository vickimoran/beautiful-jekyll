My name is Vicki Moran. Growing up, I always had a fond interest in building circuits (anyone remember [this guy](https://www.elenco.com/product/snap-circuits-300-experiments/)?). By learning technical skills through various courses and applying this knowledge to several projects, I have become competent at designing, implementing and testing electrical systems, both analog and digital. 

<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span> I'm a third year student working towards a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College with a planned graduation month of May 2020.
