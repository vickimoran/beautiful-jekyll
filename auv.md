Find the final report [here](https://vickimoran.github.io/Final_Report.pdf), detailing the creation of an autonomous underwater vehicle that can navigate to an underwater acoustic beacon and collect data about the water surrounding the beacon.

[Here](https://vickimoran.github.io/Moran_Tech_Memo.pdf) is a short paper that I wrote describing the use of Fourier analysis to perform position measurements with underwater acoustic systems.
