GST is the phase change material commonly used in phase change memory (PCM). It has a high-resistance amorphous phase and a low-resistance crystalline phase.

In addition to being low power and low cost, phase change memory can be used in a cross point architecture, allowing for increased density and scalability.

After adapting the Ï„ and forcing functions, the temperature vs. resistivity curve for the GST device matched very closely to the experimental data obtained by Cil et al.
