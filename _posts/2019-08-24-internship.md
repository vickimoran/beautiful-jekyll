I'm nearing the end of my internship with Square as an Electrical Engineering Intern. This summer has been quite an adventure, and a whole different world from life at Mudd. Here are some of my key takeaways:
- Asking real people for help is the best way to clear confusion and find meaningful answers (Google doesn't always know best)
- People often know less than they appear to and you can fit in by just acting confident despite uncertainty
- Admitting when you don't know something can be quite satisfying and even make things move forward faster
- Eight hours (or more) of work a day is a lot - doing something you enjoy is actually really important
- Square is an awesome company and has a really collaborative culture
- Seemingly complex systems actually become quite simple once you break everything down
- How they make some components soooo tiny is still a mystery to me (don't drink coffee before messing with a PCB)
- PCB design is such a fun process and forces you to pay attention to lots of nuances
- Having windows and plants in a hardware lab makes hours of testing much more delightful
- One-on-one's really benefit both people (most people love sharing their experience and knowledge)
- The Bay Area has so! many! tech! interns! and they all have so much in common
- Few people get in to the office before 9, most get there 10 or after, and working from home or vacationing happens often
- San Francisco is a great city but the widespread homelessness is really sad and often ignored
- Diversity still kinda sucks in tech companies, especially in engineering groups and higher levels
- If it's Monday or Friday, almost everyone you talk to is gonna ask you about the weekend
- Workplace conversations are hella predictable (weather, cars, sports, tech, coffee, China)
- Actually doing something can teach you so much more than learning it in a classroom
- Finding genuine friends at work can make the day go by much faster
- Basically everyone drinks coffee and depends on caffeine
- Sleeping 8 to 9 hours a night is incredible
- Weekends are truly free time
- Free food never gets old
