[Here](https://vickimoran.github.io/Car_Safety_Report.pdf) is the final report detailing the process of developing a safety   device that can be installed in a car to prevent the issue of children being left in hot cars without a parent present. This prototype addressed the needs of our client, Kids in Danger, a nonprofit organization aiming to improve child product safety.
